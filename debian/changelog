cocaine-core (0.12.4.7+nmu1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * feat(engine): enable TCP keep alive option
    Enabling keep alive for TCP socket is required to avoid weird IPVS behavior
    on erasing a table record, which lead to infinite socket consuming and
    making us suffer from fd leakage.

cocaine-core (0.12.3.7+nmu1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Hotfix: clear msgpack zone every decode iteration.
    We have to clear msgpack zone every decoding iteration to prevent memory
    leaking for objects structure, cause they have no way to notify about
    self destruction. Hope someday we migrate to v1.* and everything will be
    fine automatically.
    It's also recommended to rebuild all your dependencies, because the
    changed file is a part of public API and implicitly marked as inline,
    which may result in unexpected behavior.

cocaine-core (0.12.3.6+nmu1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: set FD_CLOEXEC flag to prevent leakage.
  * Bug fix: fixed SIGSEGV in session when tried to obtain a dispatch name
    from an incoming remote client.

  * Bug fix: fixed string literals binding
  * Zipkin: fixes.

cocaine-core (0.12.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: fixed deadlock while terminating actors.
    If an actor frequently accepts new connections there was a chance that
    it would be deadlock'ed while terminating, because the actor's accepting
    thread stopped under the acceptor's lock.

cocaine-core (0.12.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: fixed packing typelists with implicit convertions.
    These changes may affect clients which depend on packing typelists using
    implicit conversion rules; error codes, for example. If you depend from
    typelist packing for types other than error codes, it's highly recommended
    to recompile your services, cause these symbols may be inlined into the code
    giving some weird protocol mismatch errors.

cocaine-core (0.12.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 12.0.
  * Multithreaded Actor I/O. All incoming messages are now dispatched on a
    shared thread pool, which greatly speeds the things up.
  * Protocol transitions. Service protocols can now specify state transitions
    to support dispatch hierarchies. For example, storage protocol can
    implement a write_stream() method, which switches to stream protocol on
    invocation, or Chrono Service can implement a cancellable_timeout() method
    by switching to a cancellable protocol.
  * App streaming interface. Clients can stream data chunks into the app now,
    as opposed to sending a single request chunk along with the enqueue()
    method invocation.
  * Dropped libev in favor of Boost.ASIO.
  * Logging in now handled via the Blackhole logging library.
  * Locator is now a proper service, without any special treatment. Local
    service management is a responsibility of the Context.
  * Configurable cluster discovery mechanics, including multicast and predefine
    cluster discovery plugins.
  * Routing groups re-implemented using Ketama consistent hashing continuums.

  * Bugfix: properly destroy shared channels in actors.

 -- Andrey Sibiryov <kobolog@yandex-team.ru>  Thu, 25 Jul 2013 18:49:30 +0400

cocaine-core (0.10.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.5.
  * ZeroMQ has gone completely.
  * Cocaine is no longer standalone. Multiple nodes can be linked together to
    form a cloud, at last. When an app requests a service which is not local,
    a request is made to resolve the specified service remotely.
  * Apps are now exposed as services by default. If a specific application
    should not be published, set the 'local' flag in the manifest.
  * Named queues. Drivers can now enqueue their sessions to a specific worker
    with some human-readable name. The sessions in named queues will be pumped
    before any anonymous sessions in the engine's shared queue.
  * The Locator can now be bound to a configurable port, allowing users to get
    multiple Runtimes on a single host.

  * Storage API v2. The list() method was superseded by the find() method,
    which supports tags and indexing. New blobs can be tagged via a new
    parameter to write().
